QUESTION: When do you decide when components should be split?
ANSWER: SEPARATION OF CONCERNS
-Every component should only do "one thing"
*Simplicity and Code Colocation is also an option*

Comes down to preference and team


Element Selector - elements tell the browser what to display
defined by putting the element on display ie "button" - best practice is to clearly define i.e.
selector: "app-button"
*typically used with a new component built to wrap other elements but doesn't replace one
*typical default

Attribute Selector - attributes define how they will behave
*typically used to extend a built in element
.ts
selector: 'button[appButton]'
selector: 'button.button"


.html
<button appButton>
</button>

Best practice to prefix custom attributes that are meant to be used by Angular with you application prefix
i.e. app

@Component selector works like a CSS selector
